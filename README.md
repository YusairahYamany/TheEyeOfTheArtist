# TheEyeOfTheArtist
Saw an artwork that looks absolutely wow-earning and you have no idea what the medium is? Or just an artist and coder who has wanted to see the two, um, uh, THINGS, come together? Or ANYTHING??? WELL... THE EYE OF THE ARTIST AI image classifcation model is **JUST** the thing for you! If you want to know what it does just open the code thing already, you idiot

## What IS this??? 
Okay, so even if you have, like, 0% or even a negative number percent idea WHAT ON **EARTH** is this, that is completely fine. Well, if you **DO** have a negative number percent information about this which is not possible you might need to show to a head doctor, but ANYWAYS, I'm going to explain what this is. 

SOO, this AI model will classify between oil and watercolour paintings. Yeah, only those two mediums, humans, but we'll take a vote for the third class, (think it's gonna be acrylic) and decide later. So anyway if this works (Of **COURSE** IT WILL! Right? _Right_?) if you open the code in Google Colab and upload an image (will get into that in detail later) the AI would be able to predict if it is a WATERCOLOUR or OIL painting. So that is what it _IS_.(actually _does_ but WHO CARES)
